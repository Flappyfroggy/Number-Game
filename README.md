# Number-Game
The number game is a basic game versing the computer, where you try to guess what number in between 1 - 10 the computer will guess. 

(the computer's guess will be completely random)

# Why i made it
This game was one of my first projects, just starting to code with python and experimenting with the possibilities. 
I wanted to create a game that was easy to use and colourful, but also easy to code for a beginner just starting.
